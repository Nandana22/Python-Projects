#Question:
'''
Add a new pair of key (e.g. c ) and value (e.g. 3 )
to the dictionary and print out the new dictionary.

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

Hint 1: Refer to key c  and use the assignment operator to assign a value to
the key.

Hint 2: Note that dictionaries are unordered collections, so don't worry
about the order, it's always random.
'''
#Answer:
'''
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
d["c"] = 3
print(d)

Explanation:

Adding pairs of keys and values is straightforward as you can see.
Note though that you cannot fix the order of the dictionary items.
Dictionaries are unordered collections of items.
