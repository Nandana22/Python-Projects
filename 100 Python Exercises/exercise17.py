#Question:
'''
Calculate the sum of the values of keys a and b .

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print(d["b"] + d["a"])

Hint: Access the values as you did in the previous exercises.
'''
#Answer
'''
print(d["b"] + d["a"])

Explanation:

It's as easy as that. However, if you want to do the sum of all dictionary
values you need to take another approach instead of accessing all values one
by one. We're going through that approach later on in another exercise.
