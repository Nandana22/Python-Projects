#Answer:
'''
import math
print(math.pow(2, 3))

Explanation:

You could pass any number there, so 3 is just an example. As the error
suggested, you simply needed to pass a second argument so that pow  can
calculate the power of the first argument. If you didn't understand the error,
you could do help(math.pow) to see how the method works.
