#Question:
'''
Complete the script so that it prints out letter i  using negative indexing.

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

Hint: It would be silly to count from start to end since i is located closer
to the end than to the start of the list.

#Answer:
'''
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]
print(letters[-2])

Explanation:

Besides the left-to-right positive indexing system that starts from zero,
sequence data types such as lists also have a second indexing system that
starts from -1 and decreases by one from right to left.
